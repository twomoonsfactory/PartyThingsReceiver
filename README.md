# PartyThingsReceiver
Custom receiver application for a Chromecast app.  Built with AngularJS.

This Chromecast game will debut for Android, but ultimately for iOS as well.  This is the receiver side, and is still in progress.  The back end logic is there, and I am working on updating the testing for the refactored application (I added Webpack).  Front end development is in progress as well.
