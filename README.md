# PartyThingsReceiver
Custom Receiver Application for a Chromecast app.  Built with AngularJS.

<b>You may view a live demo of this application at:</b>
http://www.twomoonsfactory.com/partythingsdemo
As this is a demo, there will be buttons for purposes of simulating live user input, which in production will be done via Sender applications from various mobile devices.  This Receiver application will appear on the users' television or monitor and will run the game, reaching out to the Sender applications with updates and input requests, processing their input appropriately turn by turn.

The Sender applications for this Chromecast party game are in progress for both iOS and Android, and should be available soon.  If you have any questions/suggestions, please feel free to open an issue, or e-mail me at aj@twomoonsfactory.com.
